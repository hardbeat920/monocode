> [!NOTE]
> **Try the new [Monocode Native preview](https://github.com/hardbeat920/monocode/releases)**, our experimental Rust + GPUI app for macOS, Linux and Windows. Read the [preview details](#monocode-native-preview) before installing.

Works with your subscriptions on Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Grok Build, OpenCode, Antigravity, Pi, omp, fx, Hermes Agent, and Devin. If they’re installed and logged in, MonoCode can run them. Tabs are sessions. The composer is the input. MonoCode does not sell tokens.

## Install

Install and sign in to at least one supported agent first. See [provider setup](docs/providers.md) for instructions.

| Platform | Download |
| --- | --- |
| macOS, Apple Silicon | [MonoCode.dmg](https://dl.usemono.dev/MonoCode.dmg) |
| macOS, Intel | [MonoCode_x64.dmg](https://dl.usemono.dev/MonoCode_x64.dmg) |
| Linux, x86_64 | [.deb, .rpm, or AppImage](https://github.com/hardbeat920/monocode/releases/latest) |
| Windows, x86_64 | [Installer](https://github.com/hardbeat920/monocode/releases/latest) |

On macOS, open the DMG and drag MonoCode to Applications. On Windows, run the installer. See [Linux setup](docs/install.md) for dependencies and package instructions.

## Get started

Open a project folder, choose an agent, and send a message. Each tab is a session. Split panes to work with sessions side by side.

- Keep conversations organized by project.
- Use separate Git worktrees for parallel tasks.
- Edit files and review changes in the app.
- Start a message with `/operator` to let an agent open sessions and manage worktrees and notes.

Monos are experimental agents that work across your projects. They keep a memory and can run scheduled tasks you set up with them.

MonoCode is still early. If something breaks, [report a bug](https://github.com/hardbeat920/monocode/issues).

## Guides

Type `/operator` at the start of a composer message to enable MonoCode access in that thread. For example, `/operator start two Codex sessions: one to inspect the API and one to review the UI`, or `/operator list my notes`. The slash picker also offers this command. The transcript shows only the request text in a translucent amber bubble; MonoCode removes the command from the request sent to the agent and supplies the local `app` CLI path and instructions on that turn. Later turns in the same thread can use the CLI without repeating `/operator`; other threads receive no CLI instructions or app access. The CLI can act only during an active agent turn. The agent can run the shown `app --help` command for the exact JSON input fields.

- `models.list` shows available providers, models, settings, and permission modes.
- `sessions.start` opens a tab in the current project with a prompt. Set `placement: "right"` or `placement: "down"` to split the calling session's pane instead; `besideSessionId` selects another visible session pane in the project. Reuse the returned session ID as the next `besideSessionId` to build nested layouts. By default it submits the prompt; set `draft: true` to save it unsent without starting an agent turn. It accepts a provider, model, effort or other model settings, permission mode, and current checkout or new worktree choice. Set `worktreeCwd` to a path from `worktrees.list` for a specific existing checkout. Use `worktrees.create` to create a worktree on a named new or existing local branch, then pass its path as `worktreeCwd`. Omit `runtimeMode` to inherit the calling session's permission mode, or set it explicitly to override. It returns the new session ID as soon as the pane and prompt are accepted, so the agent can move it into a folder immediately.
- `sessions.list` shows project sessions and their archived status. `sessions.read` returns up to three recent user/assistant exchanges, with a cursor for older exchanges and a per-message character cap. `sessions.send` submits a follow-up to an idle session, while `sessions.draft` saves an unsent message for the user to review. `folders.list` and `folders.move` organize project sessions in sidebar folders, including a new folder.
- `sessions.stop`, `sessions.archive` and `sessions.delete` take a `sessionId` to manage another session in the project. Monos can select an assigned project with `project`. Stop cancels the current turn and pauses queued messages; archive accepts only idle sessions, saves the conversation for later restoration, and returns whether the archived state changed; delete stops and permanently removes the conversation. Open files, terminals and worktrees are kept. These actions cannot target the caller, Mono chats, habit runs or orchestration workers. Reuse the same request ID when retrying a call.
- `sessions.unarchive` clears the archive flag for another session without opening it. Monos can select an assigned project with `project`; it returns whether the stored state changed.
- When a Mono successfully stops, archives or deletes a session it is monitoring, its pending completion report for that session is dismissed, including any queued report. The Mono confirms the action in its current reply. Reports for other sessions and other Monos are kept. Rejected launches or follow-ups return a CLI error without a later completion report.
- `notes.list` returns titles and short previews; `notes.read` returns one full note by ID.

Orchestration workers keep their existing scoped `control` workflow and do not receive this app access.

## Build from source

You’ll need Node.js 20+ and a stable Rust toolchain. See [build setup](docs/building.md) for platform dependencies and packaging.

The mobile app is a separate Expo project in [`mobile/`](mobile/README.md). Run it with `cd mobile && npm install && npm start`.

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

## Monocode Native preview

The Rust + GPUI app is an experimental preview. React/Tauri remains the
production app.

Download a packaged preview for macOS, Linux or Windows from the
[releases page](https://github.com/hardbeat920/monocode/releases). See
[known limitations](docs/native/parity.md) before testing.

You can install it alongside MonoCode, but **the preview uses your existing
MonoCode database and saves changes there**. Back up your data with the app
closed before testing, and avoid editing the same conversations in both apps
at once.

To try GPUI from this checkout with Node.js 22+, Rust and Xcode on macOS:

```sh
npm run native:dev     # launch with a separate development database
npm run native:build   # create an optimized app using installed MonoCode data
```

Type `r` then Enter in the development terminal to rebuild and restart; there is
no hot reload. The release app saves changes to your installed MonoCode data.
See the [native guide](docs/native/README.md) for prerequisites, build output,
checks and preview limitations.
